# Introduction

#### What is RStudio?

[Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is a **FREE** integrated development environment (IDE). RStudio is specifically tailored to the use of [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) programming language. IDEs are coding environments that offer additonal programming and quality of life features. In short, RStudio offers a terminal for running R code, package management system, and text editor. Additionally, RStudio has an excellent graphical user interface (GUI) for navigating R environments and offering features such as saving and exporting files in a similar way to Microsoft Word, adding a sense of familiarty to navigate what can be an intimidating task.

#### What is VS Code?

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), like RStudio, is an IDE. In principal, VS Code offers everything that RStudio can offer and more with the major caveat in that VS Code is not centered around R, and requires users to customize their IDE whilst avoiding inadavertantly bypassing guardrails that RStudio may offer for inexperienced users. VS Code in its most simple form is a very powerful text editor. It has support for nearly all major programming languages augmented by plugins for performance boosts or non-coding related for ease of managment. In my hands, I use VS Code as my all-in-one swiss army knife for many of my day to day tasks. Coding, writing, organizing files, designing figures, etc. all are possible in one screen, and in one space, including making this tutorial.


#### Which to choose and why

With any task, it is crucial to use the best tool for the job and if you are only using R, either IDE will get the job done. At the end of the day, the user must decide what tool to use to effectively complete the task. There are many ways to skin a cat and many ways to solve a coding problem. Do whatever you want just do it right. VS Code come to me as a natural next step for moving past R and RStudio and into more complex programming. Largely everything in RStudio can be replicated in VS Code at the expense of user effort but may not be appropriate for inexperienced users only trying to learn R. Simply put, RStudio keeps users siloed in the R environment. Both IDEs are worth learning and each have merit, however, I believe VS Code facilitates learning and puts more coding topics on user's radar which they may not have been exposed to be using RStudio. I believe with proper set up and managment of VS Code, short comings from user experience or R coding support in VS Code can be overcome and create a better user experience for work and learning. Furthermore, it has been my experience with RStudio that it is cumbersome and ineffecient in computaional resourse management.

#### Philosophy

This guide is not an exhaustive or comprehensive comparison for the two IDEs and is meant to support code writing learning but keeping 'training wheels' available to avoid costly mistakes or going down rabbit holes of plugins. Addittionally, I believe the larger learning curve of VS Code takes R programmers (Biologists in Particular) elevates coding skills in the long term.
